NetCDF:
  __doc__: >
    NetCDF4 parallel I/O is being implemented in ParFlow. As of now only output capability is implemented. Input
    functionality will be added in later version. Currently user has option of printing 3-D time varying pressure or
    saturation or both in a single NetCDF file containing multiple time steps. User should configure ParFlow
    (pfsimulator part) "- -with-netcdf" option and link the appropriate NetCDF4 library. Naming convention of output
    files is analogues to binary file names. Following options are available for NetCDF4 output along with various
    performance tuning options. User is advised to explore NetCDF4 chunking and ROMIO hints option for better I/O
    performance. HDF5 Library version 1.8.16 or higher is required for NetCDF4 parallel I/O

    help: >
      [Type: int] This key sets number of time steps user wishes to output in a NetCDF4 file. Once the time step count increases
      beyond this number, a new file is automatically created.
