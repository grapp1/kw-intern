  InputType:
    help: >
      [Type: string] This key specifies the type of well to be defined for the given well, well_name. This key can be either Vertical or
      Recirc. The value Vertical indicates that this is a single segmented well whose action will be specified by the user.
      The value Recirc indicates that this is a dual segmented, recirculating, well with one segment being an extraction
      well and another being an injection well. The extraction well filters out a specified fraction of each contaminant and
      recirculates the remainder to the injection well where the diluted fluid is injected back in. The phase saturations at
      the extraction well are passed without modification to the injection well.
      Note with the recirculating well, several input options are not needed as the extraction well will provide these
      values to the injection well.

  Action:

    help: >
      [Type: string] This key specifies the mechanism by which the well works (how ParFlow works with the well data) if the input
      type key is set to Vertical. This key can be either Pressure or Flux. A value of Pressure indicates that the
      data provided for the well is in terms of hydrostatic pressure and ParFlow will ensure that the computed pressure
      field satisfies this condition in the computational cells which define the well. A value of Flux indicates that the data
      provided is in terms of volumetric flux rates and ParFlow will ensure that the flux field satisfies this condition in
      the computational cells which define the well.
