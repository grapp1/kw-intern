      [Type: string] ParFlow can operate using a number of different solvers. Two of these solvers, IMPES
      (running in single-phase, fully-saturated mode, not multiphase) and RICHARDS (running in variably-saturated mode, not
      multiphase, with the options of land surface processes and coupled overland flow) are detailed below. This is
      a brief summary of solver settings used to simulate under three sets of conditions, fully-saturated, variably saturated
      and variably-saturated with overland flow. To simulate fully saturated, steady-state conditions set
      the solver to IMPES. This is also the default solver in ParFlow, so if no solver is specified, the code solves using IMPES.
      To simulate variably-saturated, transient conditions, using Richardsâ€™ equation, variably/fully saturated,
      transient with compressible storage set the solver to RICHARDS. This is also the
      solver used to simulate surface flow or coupled surface-subsurface flow.

        In the case of 1D meteorological forcings, CLM requires four files for vegetation time series and one vegetation map.
        The four files should be named respectively lai.dat, sai.dat, z0m.dat, displa.dat. They are ASCII files and
        contain 18 time-series columns (one per IGBP vegetation class, and each timestep per row). The vegetation map
        should be a properly distributed 2D ParFlow binary file (.pfb) which contains vegetation indices (from 1 to 18).
        The vegetation map filename is veg_map.pfb. ParFlow uses the vegetation map to pass to CLM a 2D map for each
        vegetation variable at each time step. In the case of 3D meteorological forcings, ParFlow expects four distincts
        properly distributed ParFlow binary file (.pfb), the third dimension being the timesteps. The files should be named
        LAI.pfb, SAI.pfb, Z0M.pfb, DISPLA.pfb. No vegetation map is needed in this case.

      [Type: int] This key gives the maximum number of convergence failures allowed. Each convergence failure cuts the timestep
      in half and the solver tries to advance the solution with the reduced timestep. The default value is 3.
      Note that setting this value to a value greater than 9 may result in errors in how time cycles are calculated.
      Time is discretized in terms of the base time unit and if the solver begins to take very small timesteps
      smallerthanbasetimeunit1000 the values based on time cycles will be change at slightly incorrect times. If the
      problem is failing converge so poorly that a large number of restarts are required, consider setting the timestep to a
