      [Type: int] This section describes how processors are assigned in order
      to solve the domain in parallel.
        - P allocates the number of processes to the grid-cells in x.
        - Q allocates the number of processes to the grid-cells in y.
        - R allocates the number of processes to the grid-cells in z.
      Please note R should always be 1 if you are running with Solver Richards
      unless you are running a totally saturated domain (solver IMPES).'
