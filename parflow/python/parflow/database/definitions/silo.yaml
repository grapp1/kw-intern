  WriteSiloCLM:

      [Type: boolean/string] This key specifies whether the CLM writes two dimensional binary output files to a silo binary format. This data
      may be read in by VisIT and other visualization packages. Note that CLM and silo must be compiled and linked
      at runtime for this option to be active. These files are all written according to the standard format used for all
      ParFlow variables, using the runname, and istep. Variables are either two-dimensional or over the number of CLM
      layers (default of ten).

# SILO options
SILO: # typo in documentation
  __doc__: >
    These keys are used to control how SILO writes data. SILO allows writing to PDB and HDF5 file formats.
    SILO also allows data compression to be used, which can save significant amounts of disk space for some problems.

  Filetype:
    help: >
      [Type: string] This key is used to specify the SILO filetype. Allowed values are PDB and HDF5. Note that you must have
      configured SILO with HDF5 in order to use that option.

    domains:
      enumDomain:
        enumList:
          - PDB

  CompressionOptions:
    help: > # typo on 'available' in manual
      [Type: string] This key is used to specify the SILO compression options. See the SILO manual for the DB_SetCompression
      command for information on available options. NOTE: the options available are highly dependent on the configure
      options when building SILO.
